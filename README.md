# Algorithm-Visualizer
> This is a capstone Project. The app focuses on visualization of some widely used algorithms.

1. BFS
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Bubble Sort

It is a work in progess and many more algorithms will be added in the future.

### The project is deployed at -  [Algorithm Visualizer](https://algorithm-visualizer-9c27e.web.app/). Check it out!!

Dijkstra Algorithm - The image above diplays the given starting point as green block and ending point as red block. The blue blocks are wall and we can't pass through them and brown blocks have double weight of a normal block which means it would be 2x costliers if we pass through brown block in comparison with white block. White block are normal blocks.
The Algorithm finds the path which have the minimum cost.

The minimum cost path is shown above in yellow.
